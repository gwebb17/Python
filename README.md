# Python

Included in this repository are the various projects I have completed utilizing Python, Tkinter, and the Django framework.

Projects:
Phonebook
Check Files GUI
Django_Checkbook_Project
DjangoUniversity

Phonebook:
Basic app that allows user to create and save new contacts that works with a database. Also allows user to update/delete previous entries.

Check Files GUI:
Basic program that allows .txt files to be moved between directories.

Django_Checkbook_Project:
Using Django this is a basic web application that mimics a checkbook and allows transaction record creation and balance information that is updated with new entries.

DjangoUniversity:
Using Django I created a project that shows Courses/Teachers from a mock university and allows creation of new courses through the admin. Showcases configuring files to work together and setting up the various directories and file hierachy to achieve clean organizational structure.
